eaf-scripts
===========

ELAN Annotation Format (EAF) is a file format for linguistic
annotations. When I started working at the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics, there was only one publicly accessible annotated
video for testing of EAF-based tools -- a guy giving directions to a
nearby town -- that quickly became irritating to listen to.

Thus, I wrote these scripts to convert from common formats for song
lyrics (.lrc) and movie subtitles (.srt and MicroDVD .sub) into EAF so
I could have some more interesting material to test with. I wrote each
script on the train on my way to work (which is not as impressively
productive as it sounds: the trip was over 1.5 hours).
